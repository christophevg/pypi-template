# Contributing

This is Open Source software, so [given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law). Your contributions are more than welcome.

This project is hosted on [GitHub](https://githhub.com/christophevg/pypi-template) and these (common) rules apply:

* Do use the [issues tracker](https://githhub.com/christophevg/pypi-template/issues).
* Let's discuss any proposed change or fix in an issue, so your work is not done in vain - I hate to reject pull requests...
* Create [pull requests](https://githhub.com/christophevg/pypi-template/pulls) against `next` branch.
* Try to keep pull requests "atomic", and if possible related to an issue.

## My Development Workflow

I try to develop pypi-template in a self-hosting way, which means that I run it from the repository on the repository itself.

Running pypi-template from the repository can be done according to the following steps:

### Setup an Environment with Dependencies

I started using PyEnv recently and the top-level Makefile in the repository is using that. So if you go down the PyEnv road, you can use it ;-)

Minimal survival commands: 

[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)

```console
$ make requirements
pypi-template (set by /Users/xtof/Workspace/pypi-template/.python-version)
```

If you want to use a different virtual evironment manager, or none, simply issue the usual...

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running pypi-template from the Repository

```console
% python -m pypi_template verbose edit all apply
