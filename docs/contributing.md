# Contributing

This is Open Source software, so [given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law). Your contributions are more than welcome.

This project is hosted on [GitHub](https://githhub.com/christophevg/pypi-template) and these (common) rules apply:

* Do use the [issues tracker](https://githhub.com/christophevg/pypi-template/issues).
* Let's discuss any proposed change or fix in an issue, so your work is not done in vain - I hate to reject pull requests...
* Create [pull requests](https://githhub.com/christophevg/pypi-template/pulls) against `next` branch if it is currently actively used, else use the `master` branch.
* Try to keep pull requests "atomic", and if possible related to an issue.

## My Development Workflow

I try to develop pypi-template in a self-hosting way, which means that I run it from the repository on the repository itself.

Running pypi-template from the repository can be done according to the following steps:

### Setup an Environment with Dependencies

PyPi Template is (highly optionated) convention driven and relies on Pyenv to keep everything nicely tucked away in [virtual environments](virtual-environments). So at this point avoiding Pyenv is not really an option.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/christophevg/pypi-template.git
$ cd pypi-template
$ pyenv virtualenv pypi-template
$ pyenv local pypi-template
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ make install
$ make run
```

And if everything goes well, PyPi Template is run on itself, reporting every file is up2date.

### Running pypi-template from the Repository

As shown in the final command above, the `Makefile` allows for running the application/package. The default `RUN_CMD` is `python -m package_name` without any arguments. Using `RUN_ARGS` additional arguments can be added, which in case of PyPi Template itself is done in `Makefile.mak`: `RUN_ARGS = verbose debug apply`.

So, we can replace these to first edit alle variables and then actually apply them:

```console
% make run RUN_ARGS="verbose edit all apply"
pyenv local pypi-template-run
python -m `cat .pypi-template | grep "^package_module_name" | cut -d":" -f2` verbose edit all apply
